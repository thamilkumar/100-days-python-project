# weeks left in you life span upto 90 years
age=input()
#check for the input type!,then change the type
years=90-int(age)
#claculate weeks (1y=52weeks)
weeks=years*52
# print it with string

  #PROJECT _2
#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line
